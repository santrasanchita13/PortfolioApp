# PortfolioApp
My portfolio

This app is a showcase of my Android development skills and a means to contact me for new apps. Instead of relying on a resume, I've built this app to make it easier to measure my app performance.

The app has material design, animations, custom components and Google API integration to show a small sample of my skills.

If you have interesting and challenging work for Android development, please use this app to assess my skills and contact me.
