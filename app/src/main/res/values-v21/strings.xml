    <string name="main_activity_info">I\'m calling this app my showcase because my other apps are not public. I\'ve shown a small preview of
    how my apps tend to feel. You\'ll notice the performance of the app is high even with 3D layouts and animations. Each transition,
    click, swipe action is added while keeping performance in mind.</string>

    <string name="introduction_activity_info">Notice that the animation from one page to another is logical and mild.
        The design is logical and the gist of the page can be understood at a glance without reading a lot because of the graphs.</string>

    <string name="skills_activity_info">The pie chart is a custom component i.e. it\'s created from scratch unlike
        let\'s say a button which is provided by the Android framework. It fits with the logic
        of showing my strongest skills in one place, as well as showing my capability of creating custom components when needed.</string>

    <string name="interests_activity_info">I kept this page a bit glamorous because it shows my interest in bringing challenging
        designs to life. The design and the positions of the images were a challenge. There was also a lot of struggle and
        calculation involved in ensuring the correct item moves to the center on click.</string>
